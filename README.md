# refactor
For this project, I started by combining '.benefit-lead, .benefit-cost, .benefit-brand' & '.search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing' in style.css.
I also cleaned up several <div> sections by making them the proper <section> tags.
The link to "search engine optimization" was not working so I added a "class ID" to make the code function properly.
Cleaned up both header & footer so the style looked as it does in the mock-up.
Fixed website title to match company name.
